                    I am dedicated to continuing the development of Yugto, as 
                    it is a project that we worked hard on in the past and 
                    believe has great potential to transform last-minute 
                    studying into a more efficient and less stressful experience, 
                    improving academic performance and developing better study 
                    habits. Yugto is an innovative educational platform made 
                    to support students who often find themselves cramming 
                    or procrastinating. It offers tools and resources specifically 
                    designed to enhance productivity and manage time effectively, 
                    helping students stay organized and meet deadlines.
