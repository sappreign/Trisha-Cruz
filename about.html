                <p class="intro">
                    I am excited about the opportunities that may arise within 
                    learning more about systems and AI technology, which are 
                    fields that I believe will shape the future of technology.

                <h2>Experiences</h2>
                <p>
                    During the past year, there have been numerous projects 
                    given to us by professors to do. These projects include 
                    website development, image editing, video editing, 
                    graphic design, and robotics. The said projects made me 
                    acquire newly found skills and have developed my current 
                    skill set although I am still in the process of widening 
                    my scope of abilities.
